II. Requirement Specification  

II.1 Problem description  

Customers often struggle to choose perfumes that truly match their preferences, occasions,  

and budgets due to the subjective and complex nature of fragrance selection. In both physical  

stores and online platforms, consultation is often limited or inconsistent, leading to decision  

fatigue, low confidence, and abandoned or unsatisfactory purchases.  

Meanwhile, perfume retailers face operational challenges such as inefficient inventory  

management, poor synchronization between in-store and online sales channels, and difficulty  

managing customer data across multiple platforms. Although large volumes of purchase and  

review data are available, most retailers lack effective tools to transform this data into  

actionable insights for personalization, trend analysis, and targeted promotions.  

PerfumeGPT addresses these issues by providing a unified web and mobile platform that  

combines AI-powered personalized perfume consultation with centralized retail management.  

The system enables intelligent fragrance recommendations while supporting inventory  

control, omnichannel sales, customer relationship management, and data-driven  

decision-making, improving both customer experience and business efficiency.
